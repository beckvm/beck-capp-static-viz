## Does Money Talk? An exploration of budget allocations and how they are (or are not) reflected in day-to-day services in Chicago

CAPP 30239: Data Visualization for Policy Analysis

### Project Description
This project seeks to briefly explore the city of Chicago's budget and the ways in which residents might see this money at work.
Transparency in city finances is important to both efficiency and trust in city services and departments.  While the city's yearly budgets are
free to view online, it is harder to understand where this money is going and how it might relate to everyday services such as the library, public
safety, or street maintenence.  These data visualizations explore where there might be disparities between where money is used vs how much services improve or expand.  We also ask whether changes in budget allocations show any indication of affecting performance or efficiency of various city departments.
