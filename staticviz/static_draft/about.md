# Does Money Talk?

Tori Beck

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal.

## What form do you envision your final deliverable taking? (An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)
I imagine the final deliverable being more like an infographic, just to give the audience an understanding of where money goes and 
how that may or may not translate to the actual services provided.
