# Does Money Talk?

Tori Beck

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?
My current goal is to demonstrate how the city of Chicago budget changes over time, specifcally in relation to everyday public goods or services that people come into contact with,
such as the library, public roads and infrastructure, police, etc.  I want to gain an understanding of how money is allocated throughout the city and how it affects
people's day to day lives, if at all.  My general goal hasn't changed since the proposal, but I've gotten a bit more specific.  Instead of using high level census demographic
data, I found datasets from CDP about specific services/departments throughout the city including the 311 dataset, police sentiment data, and library data.  These more directly relate
to the departmental budgets.  

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?
I'm not using any mock data and don't have a lack of data sources, however I've been running into a bit of a mental block in terms of how to visualize these datasets in relation to each other.
Mainly, because I'm using yearly budget data across 5 years, that's only 5 data points per department, and I am having some trouble figuring out a way to use and display 
that information in an interesting way.

## What form do you envision your final deliverable taking? (An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)
I imagine the final deliverable being more like an infographic, just to give the audience a general understanding of where money goes and 
how that may or may not translate to the actual services provided.  I haven't figured out any kind of narrative arc or something I'm trying to persuade people of yet.
